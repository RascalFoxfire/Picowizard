Picowizard ISA tips and tricks for software developer
####################################################################################################
The Picowizard ISA is designed for pure compactness and as that, some sacrifices had to be made
programming comfort and performance wise. This also includes the lack of more advanced features like
a dedicated compare instruction or a shift unit. However, these short comings can be partially
negated with some intelligent code design, patterns and some less obvious optimizations within the
ISA itself.


Tips for assembler programmers
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a collection of different optimizations for assembler/hexadecimal

Arithmetics:
- Comparing two values can be done with a subtraction, followed up by an ADC on an empty register to
  get the carry bit. This register with the carry bit (or zero) can then by checked with BIZ. If it
  is zero, then A < B but if there was a carry then A >= B. To find out if A > B or A = B the actual
  result of the subtraction can be checked. If the result is zero then A = B, if not then A > B
- Right shift can be achieved by using ADC with the same register as source A and B to "barrel shift"
  the value. Meanwhile a normal left shift can be simply achieved by using ADD instead.
- Subtraction is achievable by inverting the minuend with NAND and then use ADC. The NAND instruction
  automatically sets the carry register to 1 to correct the computation.

Loops:
- For/iterative loops in ISA version 1.1 can be simplified when using SRAM memory for the routine.
  The initial loop value can be loaded with LDI which uses the follow up byte as value. This value
  byte can also be manipulated by STRA and LDA to increment/decrement it while in the next iteration
  this updated value gets then again loaded by the LDI instruction.
