PWH1_2: a Picowizard SystemVerilog implementation by RascalFoxfire
####################################################################################################

Introduction
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The PWH1_2 is a small upgrade over the original PWH1, extending from the 1.1.0 to the 1.2.0 ISA
specification. The address space is similar to PWH1 undefined as the CPU can be used as an IP-block
in whatever external configuration it is needed.

It needs a memory block with separated data input and output port, one address selection port and
one read and write enable port (load enable can be ignored for some memory blocks).

The CPU itself needs four clock cycles to execute one instruction (load, execute, write back, wait).
With that the external memory has exactly 2 clockcycle time to perform a load/store operation till
the CPUs writes back. This can be extended if the memory is internally pipelined but that bears the
risk of load/store after load/store data hazards.
